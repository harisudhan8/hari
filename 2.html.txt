i wanna be happy :)
cause some times i look at your eyes 
and its enough for me to admit everything you given to me 
a soulful of sorrow 
and a body full of pain 
pain inside the head and the 
pain that blocks me to express what inside my head
the more i awkward the more i regret for the attention
you the most beautiful girl in the world
you the most dangerous drug ever 
you the only thing i addicted to 
you the only one i wanna say sorry 
the truth is bitter cause ur not mine
sorry for disturbing you...
i am ugly and poor 
un attractive 
you are the opposite of me 
everybody wanna steal my girl 
i don't gonna steal you from the place u are happy now 
but i don't let my nightmares that makes me unsleep everyday 
the beautiful nightmare and the nighmare i wish to occupy my whole life 
the dream i dont wanna let it off 
that it is you and the things i imagine myself 
thats really a lovly nightmare 
the two kids one like u and one like me 
and u the third kid lean on my shoulder 

only because of u my dreams turns from empty and blank into the most colorful and the most memorable
thats it u r not mine uuuu rrrr not mineeee..... 
my name is harisudhan
